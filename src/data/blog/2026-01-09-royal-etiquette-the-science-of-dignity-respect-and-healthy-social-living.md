## Introduction: Why Etiquette Is a Health Matter

Royal etiquette is often misunderstood as rigid rules or outdated traditions. In reality, etiquette is a **structured system of respectful behavior** that promotes emotional stability, social harmony, and psychological well-being.

Modern science confirms what royal traditions long practiced:  
**how we behave socially directly affects our mental health, stress levels, and even physical health**.

At _Royal Health_, etiquette is not about superiority—it is about **self-control, empathy, and dignity**.

*   Emotional regulation
    
*   Clear social boundaries
    
*   Calm and intentional communication
    

These principles were historically essential for leadership and governance—but today, they remain equally vital for **healthy social functioning**.
