## Introduction: What Does “Royal Sex” Mean?

At **Royal Health**, _royal sex_ does **not** refer to extravagance or excess. It means **respectful, healthy, emotionally connected intimacy** that supports physical health, mental clarity, and long-term vitality.

Modern science increasingly confirms that **healthy sexual activity and emotional closeness** are not luxuries—they are core components of a long, balanced life.

Sexual intimacy activates multiple physiological systems:

*   **Oxytocin** → bonding, stress reduction
    
*   **Endorphins** → pain relief and mood elevation
    
*   **Dopamine** → motivation and emotional reward
    
*   **Nitric oxide** → blood vessel health
    

According to the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**, these pathways influence cardiovascular, immune, and neurological function.
