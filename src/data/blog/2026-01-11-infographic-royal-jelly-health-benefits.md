## Why Is It Called Royal Jelly?

Royal jelly gets its name from its **exclusive role in feeding the queen bee**.

### The Queen Bee’s Secret Food

All honeybees start life the same way—as larvae. However, only one larva in the hive becomes the queen. The difference lies entirely in nutrition:

*   **Worker bees** feed regular larvae a mix of honey and pollen
    
*   **Future queen bees** are fed **royal jelly exclusively** throughout their lives
    

This unique diet triggers dramatic biological changes.

### What Makes the Queen “Royal”?

Thanks to royal jelly, the queen bee:

*   Grows **larger** than worker bees
    
*   Lives **up to 5 years**, compared to weeks or months
    
*   Becomes **fully fertile**, laying up to 2,000 eggs per day
    

This extraordinary transformation is why royal jelly earned its royal title—it literally creates royalty in the hive.
